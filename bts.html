                            also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists
                            of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write or co-produce much of their
                            material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide
                            range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the
                            troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love,
                            individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent
                            work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an
                            alternate universe storyline.</p>
